# Description
A lightweight web server (`com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer`) having a smell memory footprint, exposing
_health_, _env_ and _metrics_ actuators.

_TODO_ describe motivations (Adding Spring Boot web just for exposing Actuators is memory consuming) - suitable for 
applications willing to expose only a _health_ endpoint but no Rest controller for instance.
